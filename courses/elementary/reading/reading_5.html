									<h2>READING</h2>
									<h3>1	Read Maria’s diary. Tick (&#10004;) A, B, or C.</h3>

											<span class="text_bolder">Saturday 18 July	</span>
										</p>
										<p>
											We left home early in the morning, 
											but our flight was delayed and we didn’t arrive at Heathrow until late in the afternoon. 
											We were really tired, but we took a bus to our hotel because taxis in London are very expensive.
											When we got to the hotel, we had a rest and then went out to explore the city. 
											We had a quick sandwich in a small café and then headed for Oxford Street.
											I bought a jacket and some T-shirts. I wanted to buy a bag as well, 
											but I couldn’t find one that I liked. In the evening, 
											we ate in an Italian restaurant and went to a typical English pub in Covent Garden.
											We met some really nice English people and had so much fun that we didn’t get back 
											to the hotel until very late!
										</p>

											<span class="text_bolder">Sunday 19 July</span>
										</p>
										<p>
											We got up late and had breakfast in a café. 
											I had a full English breakfast, and then I had some fruit. Anna just had toast.
											After breakfast, we went for a walk around the city. We saw Nelson’s Column in Trafalgar Square, 
											Buckingham Palace, and St Paul’s Cathedral. In the afternoon,
											we had a pizza and then took a bus to the train station. Travelling by
											bus in London is a great way to see the sights. We caught an evening train to
											Stratford-upon-Avon and arrived at about nine o’clock. We went to our hotel 
											and had an early night. We wanted to get up early the next day and explore Shakespeare’s 
											birthplace.
